    <h1>Welcome to my AP GOV AI Tool</h1>
    <p>This tool is for AP Governemnt students (with APUSH support coming soon). I do not sanction the usage of this tool for cheating in any way. 
        Rather, use this tool to help yourself study, catch up on missed days, and create study guides for yourself. Have fun! 
        (Also it's a little buggy. Some issue with the AI API is causing oddd hallucinations. Trying to fix it, we'll see)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Enter your query in the little box below:</p>
    <textarea id="inputData" rows="5" cols="80" placeholder="Type something here..."></textarea>
    <br>
    <button onclick="sendData()">Submit</button>
    <p>Result:</p>
    <div id="Model Response"></div>

    <!-- Link to the frontend.js file -->
    <script src="App.js"></script>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> So what's next for this tool? <p>
    <p> After adding APUSH support, I'm going to create a tab system to find the different tools.
        Then, I'll look into refining the model such that the user can say "Hey I like this, it's a good response," and I can tune the model based on that.<p>
